# Music AI Compliance Navigator

Interactive tool helping artists, labels, and small music tech companies understand EU AI Act, GDPR, and artist rights obligations.

**Status:** In Progress

## What it does

Input a use case → get requirements, risks, and action steps.

## Use cases (v1.0)

1. **Consent & Attribution** — Was this data/voice/work used with permission? What attribution is required?
2. **Training Data Provenance** — Where did this model's training data come from? How to document/verify?
3. **Generated Output Rights** — Who owns what I made with AI? Can I sell it? What do I owe?
4. **Transparency & Disclosure** — When must I say "AI was used"? To whom? How?

These use cases are bidirectional—useful whether you're an artist protecting yourself or a company trying to do right.

## Tech stack
