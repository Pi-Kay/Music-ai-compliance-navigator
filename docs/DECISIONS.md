# Key Decisions

## 2026-01-25: Interface approach

**Context:** Choosing between chatbot-style interface vs. structured decision tree.

**Options considered:**
1. Chatbot (conversational, flexible, higher complexity)
2. Decision tree (structured, predictable, lower complexity)
3. Hybrid (decision tree with optional chat clarification)

**Decision:** Decision tree for v1.0

**Rationale:** 
- Scope control—chatbot invites open-ended queries I can't reliably answer
- Compliance needs precision, not conversation
- Easier to validate outputs against actual regulations
- Can add chat layer in v2 if needed

**Outcome:** TBD

## 2025-01-25: Scope limitation to music AI

**Context:** Could cover general AI compliance or narrow to music/audio.

**Options considered:**
1. General AI compliance tool
2. Music AI specific
3. Creative industries broadly (music, visual, writing)

**Decision:** Music AI specific

**Rationale:**
- Connects directly to existing Music AI documentation work
- Demonstrates domain expertise to target employers (SoundCloud, ai|coustics, Native Instruments)
- Narrower scope = higher quality in v1.0
- Can expand later

**Outcome:** TBD
