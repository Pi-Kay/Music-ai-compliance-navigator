# Key Decisions

## 2026-01-25: Interface approach

**Context:** Choosing between chatbot-style interface vs. structured decision tree.

**Options considered:**
1. Chatbot (conversational, flexible, higher complexity)
2. Decision tree (structured, predictable, lower complexity)
3. Hybrid (decision tree with optional chat clarification)

**Decision:** Decision tree for v1.0

**Rationale:** 
- Scope control—chatbot invites open-ended queries I can't reliably answer
- Compliance needs precision, not conversation
- Easier to validate outputs against actual regulations
- Can add chat layer in v2 if needed

**Outcome:** TBD

## 2026-01-25: Scope limitation to music AI

**Context:** Could cover general AI compliance or narrow to music/audio.

**Options considered:**
1. General AI compliance tool
2. Music AI specific
3. Creative industries broadly (music, visual, writing)

**Decision:** Music AI specific

**Rationale:**
- Connects directly to existing Music AI documentation work
- Demonstrates domain expertise to target employers (SoundCloud, ai|coustics, Native Instruments)
- Narrower scope = higher quality in v1.0
- Can expand later

**Outcome:** TBD

## 2026-01-25: Use case reframing

**Context:** Original use cases drafts by Ai were company-centric. Prompt to serve artists protecting themselves, not just companies seeking compliance.

**Options considered:**
1. Keep original 4 (company compliance focus)
2. Reframe as bidirectional (artist protection + ethical company use)
3. Split into separate artist vs. company tools

**Decision:** Bidirectional framing with 4 revised use cases

**Rationale:**
- "Consent & Attribution" and "Training Data Provenance" address where harm happens (input side)
- "Generated Output Rights" answers the practical question every creator has
- "Transparency & Disclosure" covers regulatory requirements + trust-building
- Same tool serves individual musicians, sound artists, startups, and target companies (SoundCloud, ai|coustics)
- Structure transfers to adjacent fields: medical AI consent, engineering traceability, accessibility voice banking

**Outcome:** TBD
