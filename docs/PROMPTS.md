## 2025-01-25: Project scoping

**Context:** Deciding third portfolio project after moon crater sonification and Music AI documentation.

**Prompt (summarized):** "What should my third portfolio project be? Options: Hugging Face sonification, 3D data viz, Music AI compliance tool, new sonification, art/science project."

**Output summary:** Claude recommended compliance navigator because it bridges existing research to usable tool, demonstrates product thinking, directly useful to target companies, and pairs well with existing portfolio pieces.

**Evaluation:** Agreed—connects dots between documentation (research) and tool (applied), shows product thinking not just artifacts.

**Action taken:** Proceeded with navigator as third project.
