## Metadata

| Date range | January 2026 – ongoing |

| Human/AI ratio | ~60/40 (strategy, decisions, evaluation: human · drafting, research synthesis: AI) |

## Overview

Interactive tool helping artists, labels, and small music tech companies navigate EU AI Act, GDPR, and artist rights obligations. Users input a use case and receive requirements, risks, and action steps.

## Scope (v1.0)

**In scope:**
- 4 use cases: consent & attribution, training data provenance, generated output rights, transparency & disclosure
- Bidirectional framing: serves artists checking for exploitation AND companies building ethically
- Music AI focus (EU jurisdiction) with transferable structure (medical, engineering, accessibility, creative tech)

**Out of scope (v1.0):**
- Comprehensive legal tool
- AI lawyer / legal advice
- Global jurisdiction coverage
- Real-time regulatory updates

## Human Contribution Statement

I defined the problem space based on gaps identified while writing the Music AI compliance documentation. I scoped the use cases, decided on decision-tree over chatbot interface, and will make all final judgment calls on legal interpretation and user-facing language. AI assists with research synthesis, code drafting, and structural suggestions—but the tool's positions and limitations are mine.

## Trajectory

This project connects to broader research directions:

- **AI Ethics in Creative Tech** — compliance as entry to larger questions of consent, transparency, artistic agency
- **Perceptual AI** — how AI systems mediate sensory experience; obligations around manipulation and accessibility
- **Neuroaesthetics** — intersection of perception science and creative practice
- **Immersive Data Storytelling** — sonification, visualization, spatial narrative as complementary modes

The Navigator is practical tool and probe into how ethical frameworks can be made usable for creative practitioners—not just legible to lawyers.

## Reflection

*(To be completed at project end)*

- What could only I do?
- What was AI good at?
- What would I do differently?
